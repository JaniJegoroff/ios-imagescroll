# Overview

This is a sample XCode project that shows how to use image view inside a scroll view with auto layout on iOS 6.

Image can be panned and zoomed. Image is centered and zoomed out initially.

# Things to note

* Remeber to add max zoom for scroll view in Interface Builder.
* Constraints for scroll view are removed programmatically and new constraints are added instead.
* Feel free to contact me if you are stuck (like I was).
