# Overview

This is a sample XCode project that shows how to use image view inside a scroll view with auto layout on iOS.

Image can be panned and zoomed. It is centered and zoomed out initially.

# Things to note

* All constrains are set in storyboard. No code for adding constraints is required.
* Remeber to add max zoom for scroll view in Interface Builder.
* Feel free to contact me if you are stuck (like I was).
